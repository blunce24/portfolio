title: First Project

I have recently finished my first front-end project with Bloc. It was building BlocJams, a replica of Spotify, utilizing HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and the AngularJS framework.

I was thankful that for this first project, Bloc did a lot of handholding. I am still rather new to this subject, so I felt this approach helped make the material more attainable.

The most enjoyable part of the project was seeing the connections between the functions I wrote and the interactive features in the application, such as mute toggling and the seek bar functionality.
