title: Why Software Development
---

My background doesn't really explain why I've chosen software development as my ideal career. I studied the natural sciences in school, and graduated from university with a degree in chemistry. Trying to make a career in scientific research, I realized that the day-to-day in the lab didn't suit me. Though that career didn't pan out, I did discover something that I loved: problem solving.

I really enjoy tackling a difficult problem, working with others to find solutions, and that eureka moment when you find a solution. My exposure to coding began roughly a year ago, and I was hooked because of the logical problem solving inherent in the field. I truly enjoy working to build an algorithm that solves a problem or provides functionality to an application.

Through learning to code on my own, and working in other fields, I've realized that software development is the one industry I can see myself in for the long haul. To me, it represents an industry filled with intelligent individuals that I would be grateful to work with, and a job that would be fulfilling and educational.
