I've been looking for interesting and informative blogs to augment my software development journey. One of the more interesting ones is [Paul Graham's collection of essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/pgh.html).

His latest essay, titled "How to Make Pittsburgh a Startup Hub", gives an insider's look at what comprises a good environment for fostering startups. It is, in a nutshell, an environment sought out by people in their 20s, us so called "millennials." Graham praises my generation, saying "how powerful it is for a city to have those people."

To a group who gets put down by most members of older generations, positive coverage is more than welcome. I truly believe that it takes all kinds of people, working together, to produce great things. And yes, that includes us young people, and therefore our wants and needs should be addressed, rather than ignored or derided.

Remember, a person is better judged by how they treat their inferiors, rather than their superiors.
